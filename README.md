# Java-Dice-Roll-Game
A simple dice roller game I created while learning Java.

This program uses the Rava Random class along with If/Else statements.

The user has a preset max amount of rolls, along with a set distance of 20 tiles on an imaginary game board.
The user starts at space 0 and the goal is for the user to land on space 20.
If they land before space 20, they receive a message stating the current space they have landed on and to try again. 
If they land on Space 20, they receive a congratulatory message.
If they do not reach space 20 by the 5th roll, they receive a message stating that they have reached the max number of rolls and 
have lost the game.
